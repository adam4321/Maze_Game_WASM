## WASM C++ Maze Game

This is a Web Assembly translation of a game that I made for an assignment for Oregon State University CS-162. It uses emscripten to compile c++ to Web Assembly and then uses JavaScript inline in the c++ to interact with the faux CLI in the browser window. This is a link to the original C++ command line version of the game. https://github.com/adam4321/Final-maze

The game is a single player command line game where the player navigates a maze. To win and exit the maze the player needs to find a key and reach the final door. You can try the game by following this link to my website where the game runs in the browser. https://adamjwright.com/wasm_maze_game/
